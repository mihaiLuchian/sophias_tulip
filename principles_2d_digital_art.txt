Remark!!! - I do not posses the correct vocabulary on how to speak about aesthetics, so I will just write it how I see it.

If we were to compare digital art to traditional art, I would say that it is a lot harder to make something digital look good. Why does simply using a blur filter on an image suck and why does a gaussian blur look better than a box blur. Why do the photoshop filters look horrible?

In my view, here are some principles that help explain why some digital filters look horrible, uninteresting, while other looks absolutely delicious.
	1. The brain of the watcher should not be able to find the pattern on how the pixels are modified.
		Examples: transparency filter, rotations, constant offsets, simple gradients, bulge effects. The 	brain can easily find the pattern behind these transformations.
